1. There is a tremendous need for coordinated and accessible home-based services for seniors

*Desc*: As the economy continues to decline and the state cuts services for seniors, the need for more cost effective and coordinated community-based solutions deepens. According to Aging and Independent Services, 20% of seniors have serious concerns about finding affordable homecare services. Healthcare issues and chronic disease also compound these struggles. As people age they become more susceptible to chronic disease which is the major cause of death among older adults.


2. The risk factors and co-occurring issues for girls who are identified as at-risk for juvenile delinquent and/or sexually risky behavior.

*Desc*: Let’s face it, teens are having sex. In high schools across the U.S., nearly one-half (47 percent) of students state they are having sexual intercourse. The average teenager feels invincible and has little fear of becoming HIV+. Most believe that HIV only happens to other people. However, teens and young adults make up the largest number of HIV cases reported in recent years. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimate that there are at least 15,000 HIV+ young people between the ages of 13 to 24 years old living in the U.S. Yet, most HIV+ teens remain unaware of their infection, or that they were even at risk for HIV.

3. To support the Senior Services Program and its endeavors to serve Japanese and API seniors living in Los Angeles.

*Desc*: Three areas of particular need in this senior population are bilingual case management, care giving to delay nursing home care and alleviate isolation, and transportation services. Japanese and API seniors living in Los Angeles and surrounding areas do not have access to needed services either because existing programs do not provide linguistically and culturally competent services or they do not qualify for services due to residency requirements.


4. Include the prevention and early identification of depression, dementia, substance abuse and suicide and other mental health issues due to the aging process, trauma and/or bereavement.

*Desc:* According to The American Geriatrics Society(link), mental illness is an important contributing factor to the disease burdens of the elderly. While the elderly do not appear to suffer, a disproportionate share of most classifiable mental illness (depression or schizophrenia, for example) are more prevelant among the aged. They have a much higher prevalence of dementing illnesses such as Alzheimer’s disease and are subject to higher rates of interpersonal loss as well. Despite substantial rates of morbidity, the proportion of elderly persons recognised as impaired and who actually receive adequate treatment is markedly lower than in younger groups. This under-provision of services persists despite the fact that treatment of mental illnesses such as depression or paranoia in the elderly has been shown to be as effective as treatment in younger groups.


5. Capacity building through technical assistance and organizational development methods for learning how to better manage nonprofit operations and programs.

*Desc:* Most nonprofits need more than money to be successful. In addition the sheer complexity of the social, health, education, economic and racial issues being addressed by many nonprofit organisations, combined with their own interrelated inter- and intra-organisational dynamics makes it difficult for nonprofits to find time and/or resources to take advantage of capacity building opportunities.
